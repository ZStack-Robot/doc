Introduction
------------

ZStack is an open source software that manages compute nodes, networks, and storage to provide infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
solution, written in Java and Python.

This documentation is a full reference of all ZStack features. If you haven't installed ZStack and tried out several tutorials,
please visit our `web site <http://zstack.org>`_  for `installation <http://zstack.org/installation>`_ and `tutorials <http://zstack.org/tutorials>`_.

Chapters in this documentation are arranged in sections of:

- **Overview**: gives your a brief background of the topic.

- **Inventory**: explains the data model of the resource (e.g. zone, virtual machine), which usually starts with a table listing
  properties of the resource, and is followed by detailed explanations of properties that are not straightforward.

- **Operations**: explains every API manipulating the resource. APIs are explained in examples of ZStack command tool that you
  will see in chapter 3.

- **Global Configurations**: explains every global configuration that can be applied to the resource, if there is any.

- **System Tags**: explains every system tag that can be applied to the resource, if there is any.

We recommend users to start with the chapter :ref:`Introduction` and read at least chapters :ref:`Resource Model <resource>`, :ref:`Command Line Tool <cli>`,
and :ref:`Query <query>` all of which are important for your daily use of ZStack. For other chapters, you can use them as references
when you need, for example, looking up chapter :ref:`Virtual Machine <vm>` when you want to find out the command for creating a VM.
